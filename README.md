# Algorithms and Language Performance

Compares the compilation and runtime of different programming languages running a variety of standard algorithms.

## Execution

Script that runs all the programs and outputs the results in a table.

## Results

| Language        | Language Version | Algorithm | Actual Performance | Actual Performance |
| --------------- | ---------------- | --------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| C               |
| C++             | $250             |           |                    |
| Java            | $80              |           |                    |
| Scala           |
| Kotlin (JVM)    | $420             |           |                    |
| Kotlin (Native) |
| JavaScript      |
| TypeScript      |

## Details

More details on the project including the language and algorithm choices, optimisation and more.

### Algorithms

The algorithms will includes ones written by me and standard implementations within the language itself when possible.

Plan:

- for search input array of ? (large number) of ints that gets searched using the below algorithms.
- Set of inputs? 5 or so arrays of varying difficult for the search algorithms.

- Search Algorithms:
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search
  - Heap Sort

### Languages

Initial Plan:

1. C/C++
2. Java
3. Kotlin (JVM)
4. Kotlin (Native)
5. Python
6. TypeScript (maybe a few vanilla JavaScript examples too)

Future:

- Scala
  - Learn language better first
- Golang
- Rust

### Optimisation

The code for each language is written best-practice of that language in mind utilising the standard libraries and common optimisation techniques. If required external libraries may be used if the standard implementations provide subpar performance. No excess optimisations will be performed for each language -- we will use the standard practices and commonly used data types within each language.
